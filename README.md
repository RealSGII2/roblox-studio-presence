# About

This is a program that will show your activity in Roblox Studio as a Discord Rich Presence.

## Features

-   Shows when you're viewing the world, or a script (the script's name is shown!).
-   Shows a counter of how long you've been on Studio.
-   Shows the name of the place you're working on.
-   Displays a button that will open the game you are working on.

## Getting Started

1. Go to the [Releases]() page to download the latest version.
2. Install the [Roblox Studio Plugin]() that comes with this program.
3. Open the file that is for your operating system. _(Running the program from a command line with the `--silent` option will hide the prompt that opens._
    - **Windows Users:** You may optionally run _silent.bat_ to automatically run this command.
4. Open Studio! It should work immediately.
    - If your presence does not show, try reconnecting the plugin by the Plugins tab in Studio, clicking the plugin, then clicking **Reconnect**.
